    "## Introduction - Mini Essay\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to write solutions in Python because:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Python is one of the most popular language after Javascript, so most people will immediately understand the code.\n",
    "  2. For those who don't know Python, Python is generally recognized as being one of the most grokable language.\n",
    "  3. Python tend to produce short code and has a lot of text parsing functions built-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ironically, when I wrote these solutions, I wilfully aimed at succintness instead of clarity.\n",
    "I did not go completely overboard on it though, sometimes writing helper functions where I could\n",
    "have easily added more level of inlined lambdas.\n",
    "\n",
    "... but I did use a lot of lambdas, map-function and filter-functions. This kind of code is cute\n",
    "but I think that embedding multiple level of lambda, map and filter obscures the goal of the code.\n",
    "Even a single map-function is more obtuse than the equivalent for-loop. The reason is simple:\n",
    "a map-function has its salient relevant code in the middle of gobbledydock, while a for loop puts\n",
    "the salient code in its own separate line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare these two equivalent forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   data = list(...)\n",
    "   foo = map(lambda x: salient-core-logic, data)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   data = list(...)\n",
    "   result = list()\n",
    "   for d in data:\n",
    "      salient-core-logic\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "In the first case, the eye must scan a complex line to find the words salient-core-logic. In the loop form,\n",
    "it is isolated on its own line, at the of a block of code. In both forms, over time, the brain rapidly\n",
    "learns to ignore the irrelevant parts. But in the function-style, the core is always embedded in the middle.\n",
    "The for-loop style always isolates the salient parts. I think this generalizes to most constructs of functional\n",
    "languages vs imperative languages. I think it's a major reason why people have negative reactions to functional\n",
    "languages. They tend to put the salient bits \"in the middle\", instead of \"in the end\".\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this explains the resistance to adopting functional-style code in almost all languages. They all have\n",
    "taken the style from the original truly functional languages without questioning the form. At the origin, the\n",
    "form was dictated by the syntax of the functional languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python, imagine that map, filter, etc were built-in syntax. Then the object being operated on could be given\n",
    "first and the salient-code on its own. For example, it could look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   data = list(...)\n",
    "   result = map data as x:\n",
    "      salient-core-logic\n",
    "   ```\n",
    " \n",
    " The interesting thing to note is that Python list comprehension made the same mistake of adopting a syntax that\n",
    " force putting the salient-core-logic in the middle of line noise. They could have put the programmer-provided\n",
    " code in the end, but they chose to put it in the middle. Look at LISP popularity. LISP had it wrong. Readable\n",
    " code, which is governed by the core syntax of a language is important. Python imperative-style bits got it right.\n",
    " I think readability was Python not-so-hidden super-power. Unfortunately, recent Python additions have got\n",
    " it all wrong.\n",

Maybe they have linter or even compiler that error out when a non-tail recursion is used?"

    "Moving a ship around. Again, I chose to create an object. My instinct is that if something seems to have a complex persistent internal state, then an object will carry the burden of the design and simplify many common tasks. It also avoid the main pain point of using list, array or tuple: the fact that the data is anonymous. That always make the algorithm more obscure since there is no indication what is what. Having named member variable clarifies semantics tremendously.\n",

    "Another cellular automata, but this time on a hexagonal grid. The fact that this was an cellular automata was only revealed in part two. Part one was merely a setup to have us read the input data and generate the initial state of the automata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like for the 3D automata, I chose to use a set of coordinates to represent the live cells. (Here, in this puzzle, the black tiles.) So the only difficulty was the hex grid. I coded hex grids inthe past, so I know their representation as a normal square grid with peculiar movement directions, so it was pretty simple to do.\n",
